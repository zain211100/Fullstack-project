Full Stack Web App with MVC (ASP .NET Core) 


I created an MVC Client/Server application, specifically a CRUD (Create, 
Read, Update, Delete) application for recording temperature data for a given day. The 
application includes dynamic functionalities, such as fetching weather data from the 
yr.no API to automatically log daily weather information. The project involved using Git 
for version control, with branches for development and feature enhancements.The project adhered to best 
practices for ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core.
